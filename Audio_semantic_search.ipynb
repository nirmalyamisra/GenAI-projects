            "    *   **Concern:** The current semantic search might be casting a very wide net for \"product-related issues\" rather than specifically identifying defect reports. The relatively high \"Distance\" scores (all above 1.4) also suggest that even these \"top\" matches are not very close semantically to the specific \"defect\" query.\n",
            "2.  **Implicit vs. Explicit Issues:** The \"dissatisfied\" comment is the only one that *could* potentially relate to a defect, but it's not explicit. Customers might be expressing product-related problems in more general terms that the current search isn't precisely capturing as \"defects.\"\n",
            "3.  **Mixed Customer Service Interactions:** The top matches represent a mix of common customer service inquiries (checking stock, asking about deals, expressing general dissatisfaction) rather than a concentrated theme around product defects.\n",
            "    *   **Trend:** This could indicate that true defect reports are less frequent, or they are worded in ways that are not being surfaced by this specific semantic search query.\n",
